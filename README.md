Futures Simulation Trading Platform 

Maybe people has well known the knowledge of stocks, but I think most of them are not familiar with futures. The main reason is because some futures concepts are not easy to understand if you do not have a lot of professional financial knowledge. But there is another    reason that is so many futures trading software is too complicated for us. Fortunately I used to be working as a futures trading Software Company for almost two years. So I want to build a simple introductory futures trading platform to let people easily to learn futures. The goal of this paper is a part of that scheme. This paper is only concentrating on the back-end of the simulation trading platform.
